## Importing wallet balances from CXC 1.0.3 wallets into CXC 2.0 wallets ##

CXC has migrated to a completely new codebase, and as such, is no longer compatible with the previous network and blockchain used by the old 1.0.3 wallets.
As part of the migration to the CXC 2.0 wallets and network, users can redeem their old wallet balances* into their new wallets.
This process is simple, but if not done correctly could risk you losing all your coins.

## NEVER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES GIVE AWAY YOUR PRIVATE KEYS TO ANYONE, THE ONE WHO HAS YOUR KEYS CONTROLS YOUR CXC ##

Please follow these simple steps
1) BACKUP your old CXC wallet, make multiple copies (most critical is your wallet.dat file!)
2) Copy that back up somewhere safe e.g USB drive, seperate computer.
3) Make a list of your wallet addresses (you may need to look in "coin control" for a full list). If coin control is not available in the send tab of your wallet, then activate this under `Å›ettings / Options / Wallet / Enable Coin Control Features`
4) For each wallet address (that you know has a balance of CXC) in debug console run `dumpprivkey 7enteryourmuewalletaddresshere`
5) Record the private key (securely & safely) that is printed there
6) As per item 2) Backup your old CXC wallet (just to be sure).  Again, critical is your wallet.dat file
7) Uninstall your old CXC wallet IF you are installing the 2.0 wallet on the same machine (to avoid any conflicts). For the sake of safety, you may also rename your CXC folder to say CXC-1.0.3-backup so it is preserved on your machine if things go wrong.
8) Install the new CXC 2.0 wallet
9) In debug console run `importprivkey KenterYourPrivateKeyHere "comment"`

You should now see your old CXC balance re-instated into the new CXC 2.0 wallet.
For security, we *strongly recommend* you now send those coins to yourself to a newly generated receive address created in your own 2.0 wallet.
